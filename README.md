# Analysis-on-crowd_count_model
 1. Crowd Size Classification
Purpose: Categorize image as having a Small, Medium, or Large crowd.
Method: Sum of all density values compared against thresholds.
 2. Stampede Zone Detection
Purpose: Identify zones with high density and abrupt movement (gradient).
Method: Use of gradient magnitude + density threshold to generate a stampede risk mask.
3. Gradient Field (Flow) Visualization
Purpose: Visualize potential crowd flow or movement direction.
Method: np.gradient() used with plt.quiver() to show vector field on density map.
 4. Population Concentration Index (PCI) Heatmap
Purpose: Identify and quantify density concentration across different regions of the image.
Method: Divide image into a 4x4 grid and calculate total density per patch.
 5. Adaptive Risk Zone Detection
Purpose: Dynamically identify high-risk zones without fixed thresholds.
Method: Calculate risk as density > mean + 1.5 * std. Overlay mask in red.
 6. DBSCAN-Based Hotspot Clustering
Purpose: Automatically discover density hotspots using unsupervised learning.
Method: DBSCAN clusters points where density exceeds a set threshold.
 7. Crowd Fingerprint Profiles
Purpose: Understand spatial distribution patterns of the crowd.
Method: Sum densities along:
Vertical axis → Vertical Profile  ; Horizontal axis → Horizontal Profile
